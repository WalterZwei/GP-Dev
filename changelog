0.9.0
* New: Support of local Files ("Local Media") (e.g. for audiobooks)
* Added option to sort episodes (in feeds, playlists and local media). Sorting supports
    * "publication date, newest first" (default)
    * "publication date, oldest first" 
    * title 
    * title, descending
    * url
* the items in the episode list are now reorderable. Tap an item and drag it to
  a new position. Use it for temporary rearrangement of the play sequence.
  Attention: Those changes are lost, when GuttenPodder is closed
* fixed another podtrapper bug: Did not load podcast, which are directory URL
  (e.g "Tagesschau in 100 Sekunden"), GuttenPodder instead stoped displaying
  anything (thanks konus|webosnations for reporting this)
* Replaced big "save" and "cancel" buttons with small 'Back' and 'Done' button in the "add feed" scene
* episode popup menu slightly changed
* Removed universal search and dockmode (temporarly); they didn't work properly
* Automatic removal of // in front of XML-Urls

0.9.1 (2013-01-06)
* Fix: Media permission dialog was not shown, so local media did not work

0.9.3 (2013-03-19)
* new: sleeptimer in the episode detail screen's menu (suggested several 
  times, e.g. by sanaking|pc). no dockmode support yet.
* new: local media search expressions are now case insensitive 
  with switchable search modes for path and/or titel (suggested by Adam Marks)
* new 'path' sort mode for episodes
* fix: manual reorder of episodes with tapping & dropping should now work 
  well. After restarting GP the last sort order is restored.
* fix: in episode description iframes and objects are now ignored; there 
  are podcasts out there (eg. psycomedia) with info text with many embedded videos, 
  resultin in many many windows (reported by Peter Mohlin)
* fix: resume playing did not work every time - I hope it works now 
  (reported by bethel95|pc)
* fix: every word of the episode title was always capitalized by webos 
* del: removed "gdgt weekly" from default feeds (it's dead, Jim)

0.9.4 (2013-06-18)
* fix: Landscape mode looks prettier now, but not perfect 
* new: filter for feed list and episode list. Just type a filter expression (case insensitive).
  On Touchpad tap the new search button for start
* new: auto update optional for one selected feed or playlist only. 
* mod: auto update time picker intervall now 5 minutes instead of 15 minutes
* fix: back button is only needed when no gesture area is availble; existence of
  physical keyboard is of no relevance. As a result on phones many stages do not show any longer a back
  button.

Known errors: 
* sometimes audio streaming does not work
* some podcast do not play because of strange http redirection 
* video podcasts are not bookmarked
* sometimes part of the feed list becomes invisible and must be scrolled to become visible again
* search via podcast.de does not work any more (I've contacted them, they did not answer)
* the translations are not complete (my fault)
* reordering feeds while filter field is in use could result in, ahm, funny optics
