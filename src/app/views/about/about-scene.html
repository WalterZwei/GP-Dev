 GuttenPodder is a podcast download and listener app for webOS devices. It is
 derrived work of drPodder, a well known podcast app by Jamie Hatfield.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li> Add your feeds
<li> Download episodes you're interested in
<li> Play Podcasts!
</ul>
    
<h3>Feed list</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to delete any of the default podcasts (Swipe it away as usual in webos). </li>
<li>You can add podcasts by url, search for podcasts or existing media files on your device 
by using the '+' icon in the bottom left on the feed screen
  <ul>
  <li>To enter the feed url directly, choose "Enter Feed URL..."<br>
  <li>To find a Podcast feed thru tags, title or content use "Search Directory..."<br>
  <li>"Search PodTrapper" opens the PodTrapper website. Browse thru the content of
       this website. To cancel the search tap the GuttenPodder icon on the website.<br>
       As soon as you have choosen a podcast, this podcast will be
       loaded into GuttenPodder. This can take a while, but no progress indicator is 
       shown (sorry for that). 
  <li>"Dynamic Playlist..." creates a virtual feed. That's a selectable mashup of
       feeds already existing in GuttenPodder
  <li>"Add local media" searches your device for existing media files (new in GuttenPodder 0.9.0).
       You can enter 
       expressions to filter by media title and/or file path. The comparison
       is case insensitive. 
       Thanks to Adam Marks for his <a href="http://www.webosnation.com/add-local-media-guttenpodder">article</a> 
       on webOS Nation about GuttenPodder's local media feature (written as of GP 0.9.1).
       <br>
       Sadly, local media function work only on webos 2.x and higher. 
       At first use, you may be asked for permisson to access the file system of your device 
       (this is called "media permission"). Some webos 2.x devices have got
       a problem here; they do not ask, but do not allow access either. <br>
       In this case you may run an application to fix this problem; you'll find 
       it at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32016000/com.palm.app.permissions-reset_1.0.0_all.ipk">
       http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32016000/com.palm.app.permissions-reset_1.0.0_all.ipk</a></li>
  </ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h4>What is a podcast?</h4>
A podcast is a type of digital media consisting of an episodic series of audio, video, PDF, or ePub files 
subscribed to and downloaded through web syndication or streamed online to a computer or mobile device
(Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Podcast&oldid=513914983">Wikipedia article "Podcast"</a>)

<h4>What is a feed?</h4>
A feed is a short file containig description, the url and some other computer
readable information about podcast episodes. 

<h4>How do I delete a feed?</h4>
As everywhere in webOS: Swipe it away (tap and hold the feed, and - without
lifting the finger - swipe it to the right). You'll be asked for confirmation.

<h4>How Do I migrate from drPodder or podFrenzy to GuttenPodder?</h4>
The easy way: use the Import/Export-Feature with file drpodder.xml or the
clipboard. You will loose the state of the feeds, but not the feeds
themself. <br>
The other way involves coping some internal database. It will keep you all
feeds, state and downloads. Hopefully. 
See <a href="http://forums.webosnation.com/webos-homebrew-apps/194583-drpodder-k-prepod-post2299374.html">this posting</a> 
and this <a href="http://www.webosnation.com/guttenpodder-latest-update-based-drpodder">article</a>
for an idea how to do it.

<h4>How do I play all Episodes in a row?</h4>
In the episode list tap once on the title bar (that thing with the name of the feed). 
The menu hided there has options to play all episodes from top or from bottom. 
<br><br>
Or you tap an episode a little longer, and select "play all from here" 

<h4>I start downloading my episodes, they get about halfway done, then stop downloading and give me an error.</h4>
Is there any chance your media partition is full? (check under Device Info-Phone-Available)

<h4>Why did you steal drPodder?</h4>
I didn't. Jamie Hatfield put his app under the "GNU public licence" (GPL).
So anybody is allowed to copy and change his app as long as this copied app is
put under the same or compatible licence. And the source of the new app must
be published (see this <a href="http://www.u32.de/guttenpodder.html">page</a>). 
The big advantage: If an application is discontinued by the
original author, the user is not left with a starving system (at least, if a
new maintainer is found).<br> 
See <a href='http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html'>http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt</a>
for the licence.
And <a href="http://forums.webosnation.com/webos-homebrew-apps/319120-guttenpodder-drpodder-fork.html#post3357130">
this post</a> may help, too.

<h4>How can I donate?</h4>
Create or update documentation and translation (no strings.json yet...).
Or answer Questions in the forum.
Or buy drPodder from the HP AppCatalog, because without drPodder there would be no
GuttenPodder

<h4>Why don't you use github for the sources?</h4>
I'll will. Someday.
In the meanwhile use this <a href="/download/de.u32.guttenpodder.src.zip">place</a>.

<h4>Why don't you make an android app? webOS is dead.</h4>
Yes it is. But I use it still on my Pre 3. So I will maintainig GuttenPodder
until my Pre will die. Physical. 

<h4>Which feature are planned?</h4>
A lot of features are impossible, because webOS does not support it. 
E.g. Speedup of podcast episodes or warning on filessystem low space.
There are some ideas, but I do not promise anything (error fixing has priority):
<ul>
  <li>display duration in episode list</li>
  <li>skip epsiode button in episode detail</li>
  <li>using the cam/photo picker for albumart</li>
  <li>enhance "edit feed" scene to select the playlists the feed is visible in </li>
  <li>enhance feed option to start episodes at fix offsets (to skip long or boring teasers)</li>
  <li>enhance feed option to filter episodes for url, description or duration </li>
  <li>unlikely: syncing with gpodder.net</li>
  <li>fix translations :)</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do you pronounce "Gutten"?</h4>
"Gutten" is somehow pronounced like "guten" as in the German greeting "Guten Tag",
but with a short "u". An association to "Gutenberg" is seemingly, 
but GuttenPodder is not named after the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">inventor of printing</a>.<br>
As you maybe know, GuttenPodder is copied from DrPodder, so you may call it
"Doctorate plagiarism" (hint: german politics in 2011 ...)
           

<h4>Are there any errors in GuttenPodder?</h4>
Sure. Use the menu "Help" and the item "Send e-mail" to report.
